Comparison             BLOSUM62 Score      Percentage Identity
Human vs Mouse               1097                 90.09%
Human vs Random              -208                  5.41%
Mouse vs Random              -209                  4.50%

3. Interpretation

The sequence alignment results show that human and mouse SOD2 proteins are highly conserved, with a BLOSUM62 score of 1097 and a percentage identity of 90.09%. This is consistent with the BLAST result showing 90.1% identity, confirming the evolutionary relationship between these two species.

In contrast, both the human-random and mouse-random comparisons yielded very low BLOSUM62 scores and low identity percentages (5.41% and 4.50%), indicating that the random sequence does not represent a biologically related protein.

Therefore, the human and mouse SOD2 sequences are the most closely related pair among the three comparisons.
