Feedback received :
- Week 3: "Commit messages for Week 3 should be informative."
- I reviewed the commit messages in Week 3. Some earlier messages were too vague, such as "update" or "finish practical3".
- I revised them to be more specific and meaningful. For example, I changed one commit message to: "check the completion status of practical3"* 
  This makes the purpose of the commit clearer to others and to my future self.
Reflection :
- Through this feedback, I realized the importance of writing clear and descriptive commit messages. They help track changes, communicate effectively in collaborative work, and make debugging easier.
- I will continue to use informative messages like "add function to parse XML" or "fix GO term extraction bug" in future projects.
